## Before each installation restart R to avoid errors due to having the
## previous version installed.

#' Install the ps _source_ package from CRAN

#' Load the package from the temporary library and try running `ps()`

#' Install the develpment version of the ps package

#' Install version 1.2.0 of the ps package from CRAN

#' Stretch goal
#' If that went well try installing the source version of git2r.
## git2r has more complicated dependencies and takes longer to compile, but
## it should install without problems
